                    <p> It's time to return to the Wizarding World of "Harry Potter." Warner Bros. Discovery has
                        officially
                        announced its plan for a decade-long television series that will be "a faithful adaptation" of
                        J.K.
                        Rowling's "Harry Potter" books. The show will serve as an original series for Max—the new, mega
                        streaming
                        service combining HBO Max and Discovery+ that arrives on May 23.
                        The series will be executive produced by J.K. Rowling, Neil Blair and Ruth Kenley-Letts, with
                        David
                        Heyman,
                        the executive producer of all eight film installments, in talks to join. Despite the numerous
                        controversies surrounding
                        author J.K. Rowling, leading to much scrutiny around the series, the franchise remains
                        incredibly
                        popular. The "Hogwarts Legacy"
                        video game, developed by Avalanche Software, has broken numerous sales records since its release
                        in
                        February.
                        The highly anticipated new series is expected to premiere on Max in 2025/2026. Here's everything
                        we
                        know
                        about the project so far.

                    <p> It's time to return to Alagaësia. Twenty years after the official publication of Christopher
                        Paolini's
                        Eragon by Alfred A.
                        Knopf Books, the author is returning to his epic fantasy world for a new standalone novel,
                        Murtagh,
                        set
                        to be released later this year.

                        As the title suggests, the new book will focus on Eragon's rival Murtagh, and will take place
                        one
                        year
                        after the end of the original
                        Inheritance Cycle. When we last saw Murtagh and his red dragon Thorn at the end of Inheritance,
                        they
                        had
                        gone off to the far corners of Alagaësia
                        in search of redemption for their time as chief minions of the evil King Galbatorix.

                        Murtagh finds them "hated and alone, exiled to the outskirts of society." Soon, though, this duo
                        finds
                        "something wicked lurking in the shadows
                        of Alagaësia," setting them off on a new journey across lands both familiar and untraveled,
                        where
                        there
                        waits a mysterious witch who is much more
                        than she seems.

                        "Returning to the world of Eragon has been an absolute blast," Paolini said in a statement.
                        "Murtagh
                        is
                        the novel I've been waiting to write for
                        over 13 years. It's a deep dive into the life of our titular character and his dragon, Thorn.
                        Here
                        you'll find mystery, magic, and revelations
                        as Murtagh attempts to answer some of the deepest questions in the land, as well as those of his
                        own
                        life. I've had a ridiculous amount of (sometimes devilish)
                        fun writing Murtagh, and I can't wait for readers to experience it for themselves. Welcome back
                        to
